# Numpy
Numpy is short for numerical python which is the fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis.      It is the foundation on which nearly all of the higher level packages are built from. ndarray is one of the key features of NumPy which stands for N-dimensional array object.   
Arrays enable us to perform mathematical functions on whole blocks of data using similar syntax to the equivalent operations.

Numpy provides:
      ndarray a fast and space efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting operations.   
      Standard mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops
      Tools for working with memory mapped files.
      Linear algebra,random number generation and fourier transformation capabilitities.
      
Data analysis applications:
      Common array algorithms like sorting,unique and set operations.  
      Efficient descriptive statistics and aggregation/summarization data.
      Group wise data manipulation(aggregation,transformation,functions,applications).
This is the N-dimensional array object or ndarray which is fast, flexible container for large data sets in python.   
Arrays enable you to perform mathematical functions on whole blocks of data using similar syntax to the equivalent operations between scalar elements.   
An ndarray is a generic multidimensional container for homogeneous data: that is all of the elements must be of the same type.
